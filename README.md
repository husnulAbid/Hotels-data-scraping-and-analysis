# Hotels-data-scraping-and-analysis

In recent years, the transportation industry has improved drastically, making it easier for people to travel. Furthermore, websites facilitate the process of booking hotels which make it simpler to make reservations. However, because of growing number of websites, it is a daunting task to find affordable accommodation that suits everyone's preferences. We simplified and improved the accommodation search process for our users. To accomplish this, we scraped accommodation data from several websites and compare among these. Moreover, we have implemented a system that interacts with user and enables to find the best accommodations for the individuals.

We have used python as a programming language for both scraping and data analysis task. More particularly, we used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from the websites. Pandas has been used for processing and cleaning the data. To visualize the cleaned data, Matplotlib and Seaborn has been used. To interact with the user, we chose Python ipywidgets library that enables us to use range slider and dropdown box.
